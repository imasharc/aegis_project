Ensure that explicit consent is obtained from job candidates for background checks, as outlined in Article 6[1] and Article 9[2].\n\n2. **Draft Consent Forms**  \n   Create clear and concise consent forms that explicitly inform candidates about the nature of the background checks, the types of data processed, and the purpose of processing. Ensure that the consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, in compliance with Article 7[3].\n\n3. **Implement Record-Keeping Procedures**  \n   Establish a system for documenting and storing consent records to demonstrate compliance with GDPR. This should include the date of consent, the method of obtaining consent, and the information provided to candidates at the time of consent, as required by Article 7[3].\n\n4. **Evaluate Data Processing Agreements**  \n   Review the data processing agreement with the Dutch HR platform to ensure it includes all necessary clauses as mandated by Article 28[4]. This includes stipulations on data security measures, data breach notification procedures, and the rights of data subjects.\n\n5. **Assess Special Categories of Data**  \n   Determine if any special categories of personal data are being processed during background checks. If so, ensure that processing is justified under one of the exceptions in Article 9(2), such as obtaining explicit consent or fulfilling legal obligations[2].\n\n6. **Align with Polish Data Protection Act**  \n   Ensure that all procedures comply with the Polish Data Protection Act, particularly Articles 6a[6] and 1[7], which reinforce GDPR principles. This includes confirming that local laws do not impose additional requirements for consent or data processing.\n\n7. **Conduct a Risk Assessment**  \n   Perform a risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with the processing of personal data during background checks. This should include evaluating the security measures in place at the Dutch HR platform and ensuring they meet GDPR standards[4].\n\n8. **Implement Data Handling Policies**  \n   Configure data handling policies based on classification levels as per Internal Security Procedures (Procedure 2.2)[10]. Ensure that personal data processed during background checks is classified appropriately and that access is restricted to authorized personnel only.\n\n9. **Establish Access Control Measures**  \n   Implement access control measures to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data related to background checks. Follow the User Account Management Process (Procedure 3.1)[12] to create and manage user accounts effectively.\n\n10. **Provide Security Awareness Training**  \n    Conduct security awareness training for employees involved in the background check process. This training should cover data protection principles, the importance of consent, and the handling of sensitive data, as outlined in Procedure 11.1[13].\n\n11. **Regularly Review and Update Policies**  \n    Schedule regular reviews of data processing agreements and consent mechanisms to ensure they remain compliant with GDPR and Polish Data Protection Act requirements. Follow the guidelines in Procedure 10.1[14] for maintaining compliance and preparing for audits.\n\n12. **Engage with Supervisory Authorities**  \n    Maintain open communication with the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection in Poland to ensure that your practices align with regulatory expectations, particularly regarding cross-border data processing[9].\n\nBy following this comprehensive action plan, your Polish subsidiary can effectively structure consent and data processing agreements in compliance with GDPR and local regulations, ensuring the protection of job candidates' personal data during background checks.\n\n*This action plan integrates guidance from multiple specialized domains with 14 precise authoritative references.*\n\n**AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE CITATIONS:**\n\n**European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):** [5 with enhanced structural detail]\n[1] Article 6, paragraph 1 (Chapter II: Principles): \"1.
