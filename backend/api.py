Enhanced FastAPI Backend with Real-Time Progress Reporting

This enhanced version demonstrates how to implement streaming progress updates
for long-running AI processes. The key insight is that modern web applications
need to provide continuous feedback during complex operations, especially when
dealing with AI systems that can take significant time to process queries.

The architecture changes here implement what's called "progressive disclosure"
of processing status, allowing users to understand what's happening and
estimate completion time rather than staring at a blank loading screen.

### Action Plan for Data Leakage Reporting Responsibilities

**1. Immediate Incident Response Team Activation**
Your company must immediately activate its incident response team upon discovering any data leakage. This team should include representatives from IT security, legal, compliance, and communications departments to ensure comprehensive handling of the incident.

**2. Conduct Preliminary Breach Assessment**
Perform an initial assessment to determine the scope, nature, and potential impact of the data leakage. Document what data was compromised, how many individuals are affected, and the potential risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms.

**3. Notify Supervisory Authority Within 72 Hours**
Under GDPR Article 33, you must report the breach to your lead supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, unless the breach is unlikely to result in risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

**4. Document All Breach-Related Activities**
Maintain detailed records of the incident, including discovery timeline, affected data categories, estimated number of affected individuals, assessment of consequences, and all remedial actions taken.

**5. Assess Risk to Data Subjects**
Evaluate whether the breach poses a high risk to affected individuals' rights and freedoms. Consider factors like data sensitivity, potential for identity theft, financial harm, or reputational damage.
