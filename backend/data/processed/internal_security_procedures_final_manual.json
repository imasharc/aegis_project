Identify data elements that match classification criteria: Level 1 (Restricted) includes proprietary algorithms, financial forecasts, merger plans, key client contracts with Westfield Healthcare, GlobalTech, and Federal agencies. Level 2 (Confidential) includes employee records, customer data, R&D information, system access credentials. Level 3 (Internal) includes general communications, public documentation, non-sensitive operational data.\nStep 2: Data Marking Requirements - Apply classification labels using Microsoft Purview Information Protection. For electronic documents, use built-in labeling tools in Office 365. For database records, implement column-level classification tags in data dictionary. For file systems, use Windows file properties to add classification metadata.\nStep 3: Verification Process - Data owners review classification assignments monthly. IT audits classification accuracy quarterly using automated scanning tools. Misclassified data triggers immediate review and correction.",
