"""
Configuration module for the Enhanced Multi-Agent Compliance System Frontend

This module centralizes all configuration settings, making them easy to modify
and maintain. By separating configuration from logic, we follow the principle
of "configuration as data" which makes the application more flexible and
easier to deploy in different environments.

Why separate configuration?
- Easy environment management (dev, staging, production)
- Single source of truth for settings
- No magic numbers scattered throughout the code
- Easier to modify behavior without touching business logic
