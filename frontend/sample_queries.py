Sample Compliance Queries for UI Demo and User Guidance

This module provides curated, user-friendly sample queries organized by business
scenarios. These samples serve dual purposes:

1. **User Education**: Help users understand what types of questions work well
2. **System Demonstration**: Showcase the sophisticated multi-agent capabilities

The queries are designed to be:
- Realistic business scenarios that EU companies commonly face
- Concise enough for easy reading but detailed enough for meaningful analysis
- Representative of different compliance domains (GDPR, Polish law, security)
- Progressively complex to demonstrate system sophistication

Design Philosophy:
Rather than overwhelming users with blank forms, we provide starting points
that they can modify or use directly. This reduces friction and helps users
learn effective query formulation patterns.
