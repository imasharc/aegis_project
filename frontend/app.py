"""
Enhanced Multi-Agent Compliance System - Streamlit Frontend

This frontend demonstrates how to create an intuitive interface for sophisticated
AI systems. The design philosophy is to hide complexity while showcasing capability -
users see a simple chat interface, but behind the scenes they're accessing a
sophisticated multi-agent architecture with GDPR, Polish Law, and Security expertise.

The interface design principles:
- Progressive disclosure: Show simple interface first, reveal sophistication in results
- Clear feedback: Users understand what's happening during processing
- Citation preservation: Complex citation structures are presented in accessible formats
- Educational value: Results help users understand compliance requirements

Enhanced with sophisticated citation formatting that converts complex citation text
into clean, numbered reference lists for improved readability and professional presentation.
